### **Author:**

- **Original:** Bigfoot  
- **Modifications & Enhancements:** Ketanna  
- **Latest Update & Maintenance:** sko & Ghost PGM DEV TEAM  

This mission file was originally edited by **Ketanna** to allow land crates to be spawned as heli crashes. The mission file can be used in conjunction with the original **Bigfootâ€™s Ship Wrecks**. The separation of heli crashes from Bigfootâ€™s Ship Wrecks allows for better control over crate spawning mechanics.

### **Summary:**

This addon spawns **Heli Crash** wrecks with **loot crates** and **markers** in random locations on the server restart.  

**No AI spawn at crates (yet),** but you can integrate AI patrols manually if desired.  
**Inventory cannot be accessed while crates are underwater** due to Arma mechanics.  
**Use R3F, Igiload, or Exile's built-in crate mounting system** to transport crates via SDVs to shore.  

**Encouraged Community Contributions:**  
This addon is open for modifications! If you improve or extend it, please share your edits on **[ExileMod Forums](http://www.exilemod.com/)** so others can benefit.

**Most settings can be configured in `config.sqf`.**
